## 🎨 Flavors

The Bubble Tea Theme now comes in two delicious flavors:

- **Bubble Tea**: The main theme, featuring a high-tech, ultra-tuned syntax for a modern and precise coding experience. It's perfect for developers who love a feature-rich and visually optimized environment.
- **Bubble Tea Classic**: A new variant that provides a more traditional syntax highlighting style. It's a great choice for those who prefer a simpler, more classic setup without sacrificing the beautiful Bubble Tea color palette.

## ✨ Features

- **Soothing Colors**: A carefully selected color palette that is easy on the eyes, perfect for long coding sessions.
- **Visual Debugging**: Colors are chosen to facilitate visual debugging, making it easier to spot issues.
- **Focus on What Matters**: The design reduces "scan time" by highlighting important elements and deemphasizing distractions.
- **Comprehensive Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced readability across a wide range of languages.
- **Custom Icon Pack**: Over 200 custom file and folder icons to give your workspace a unique and consistent look.
- **Minimalist & Clean UI**: A decluttered interface that helps you focus on what matters: your code.
